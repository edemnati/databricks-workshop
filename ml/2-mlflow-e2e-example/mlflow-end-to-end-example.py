# Databricks notebook source
# MAGIC %md # Training machine learning models on tabular data: an end-to-end example (non-Unity Catalog)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/preprocess-data/scikit-learn
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This tutorial covers the following steps:
# MAGIC - Visualize the data using Seaborn and matplotlib
# MAGIC - Run a parallel hyperparameter sweep to train multiple models
# MAGIC - Explore hyperparameter sweep results with MLflow
# MAGIC - Register the best performing model in MLflow
# MAGIC - Apply the registered model to another dataset using a Spark UDF
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this example, you build a model to predict the quality of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine based on the wine's physicochemical properties. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The example uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, presented in [*Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub) [Cortez et al., 2009].
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC This notebook requires Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If your workspace is enabled for Unity Catalog, do not use this notebook. A version for workspaces that are enabled for Unity Catalog is available: ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/end-to-end-example.html) | [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/mlflow/end-to-end-example) | [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/mlflow/end-to-end-example.html)).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Read the data
# MAGIC Read the white wine quality and red wine quality CSV datasets and merge them into a single DataFrame.

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd

white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0

data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0)

# Remove spaces from column names
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)

# COMMAND ----------

data.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Visualize data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before training a model, explore the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(data.quality, kde=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Box plots are useful for identifying correlations between features and a binary label. Create box plots for each feature to compare high-quality and low-quality wines. Significant differences in the box plots indicate good predictors of quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dims = (3, 4)

f, axes = plt.subplots(dims[0], dims[1], figsize=(25, 15))
axis_i, axis_j = 0, 0
for col in data.columns:
  if col == 'is_red' or col == 'quality':
    continue # Box plots cannot be used on indicator variables
  sns.boxplot(x=high_quality, y=data[col], ax=axes[axis_i, axis_j])
  axis_j += 1
  if axis_j == dims[1]:
    axis_i += 1
    axis_j = 0

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md In the above box plots, a few variables stand out as good univariate predictors of quality. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the alcohol box plot, the median alcohol content of high quality wines is greater than even the 75th quantile of low quality wines. High alcohol content is correlated with quality.
# MAGIC - In the density box plot, low quality wines have a greater density than high quality wines. Density is inversely correlated with quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Preprocess data
# MAGIC Before training a model, check for missing values and split the data into training and validation sets.

# COMMAND ----------

data.isna().any()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are no missing values.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare the dataset to train a baseline model
# MAGIC Split the input data into 3 sets:
# MAGIC - Train (60% of the dataset used to train the model)
# MAGIC - Validation (20% of the dataset used to tune the hyperparameters)
# MAGIC - Test (20% of the dataset used to report the true performance of the model on an unseen dataset)

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
y = data.quality

# Split out the training data
X_train, X_rem, y_train, y_rem = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.6, random_state=123)

# Split the remaining data equally into validation and test
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_rem, y_rem, test_size=0.5, random_state=123)

# COMMAND ----------

X_train.iloc[0].to_dict()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Train a baseline model
# MAGIC This task seems well suited to a random forest classifier, since the output is binary and there may be interactions between multiple variables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Build a simple classifier using scikit-learn and use MLflow to keep track of the model's accuracy, and to save the model for later use.
